		<h2>Analysis of section G18 of the <br> 2016 Australian Census</h2>
		<p>The census data gathered in 2016, has been collected, for those in Australia, in regards to a multitude of subject matters. This data’s use can be especially effective when, the correct user groups use and apply this data to the local community. The G18, section of this state wide census explores a person’s need for help or assistance in one or more of the three core activity areas of self-care, mobility, and communication, because of a disability, long-term health condition (lasting six months or more) or old age.<br><br><img src="http://www.esphealthcare.com.au/cms/wp-content/uploads/boy.jpg" alt="Whoops. Looks like something went wrong here.">
</p>


		<p>The dataset was collected for the NSW State Government to identify, which regions of <img src="https://www.education.gov.au/sites/all/themes/custom/edu2014_theme/images/base/header_circle_secondarypage.png" alt="Whoops.

		NSW requires more assistance as well as understanding how many people need help or assistance to better assist this group of people.
		 This dataset is very significant to people's lives as it will allow the correct services to be better equipped to help people who have disabilities and are less able/inclined to reach out for medical assistance. The dataset ranges from newborns to those 85 and above and could tell the state government where the most efficient spots would be to implement a new hospital or disability friendly zones. As such, the need for this data extends much further than the New South Wales state Government. Departments, such as the Ministry of Health, would be one of the most viable and foremost departments to use this data as, they are heavily invested in the care of those in the community who require aid and so would be better suited to help these individuals. The Education Department would also find this data useful, as they would have the power to better suit the education system around those in the community who have disabilities that would otherwise impede their learning.
		The Department of transport would also be able to use this information, as systems could be put in place to allow, more efficiently, those in the community with disabilities to navigate the region, such as through the implementation of more frequent forms of public transport in densely affected regions. Government bodies aside, other sectors within NSW would also benefit from the acquiring this data set in order to help the greater population. The hospitality, design and development sectors would be able to use this information to better aid the local community as they would be able to create an environment more effectively suited to those in need.<br><br><img src="http://socialmarketing4change.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DHA_inline1.jpg" alt="Whoops.

		<p><br><br><br>In regards to one's perceptions of space and how it is used by the local community, this dataset would help greatly, as it would allow us to further understand which locations, within the NSW region, require the need for mobility assistance. This information is a vital piece in the construction of city spaces as it helps to better the lives of those in the community who have physical or mental impediments. Areas such as the transportation system and even the city streets could be constructed in a way that aids those in the community who may find it hard to navigate the Sydney streets. Efforts are already being undertaking in major city centres, such as Melbourne, in order to aid those who find it troubling to navigate their way around the city.</p>


		<p>Across Sydney, trends such as where the most dense locations with those living with disabilities are very clearly evident. While observing this data mapped out on an interactive map, one can see that people with the aforementioned afflictions are more heavily populated around the suburbs and hospitals, which makes sense considering how useful living close to a hospital would be for people with treatable and more severe disabilities. The latte line is an imaginary boundary which separates those in the NSW, where If you are north of the line you are largely considered a 'have'. However, being on the southern half of that line, makes an individual largely a 'have-not'. This data set does, in part, relate to the latte line as the cost to live as a person with disabilities would mostly restrict them from buying in the more expensive areas of sydney. Looking back at the 2011 census held by the Australian Government, we may also see some extensive trends become apparent. At first glance one may assume that their would be less people in the NSW region who have a disability. However, looking at the 2016 dataset, compared to that of the 2011 census, it is seen that more people have these debilitating afflictions. This may be attributed to an overall increase in the total population of people within the NSW region. Regardless of this total population change, it would be extremely beneficial for this data set to change as improvements to the current medical system would, in turn, decrease the number of people requiring aid as disability and injury numbers would decrease.</p>

		<p>Thus, to achieve this state of equality, better medical services as well as access to these services, for areas with high untreated disabilities, will be required. Unless this happens, the number of disability cases will exponentially increase and the divide shown by the latte line will become much more apparent.
